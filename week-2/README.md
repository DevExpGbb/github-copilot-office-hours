### 1. Welcome & Week 1 Recap (3 minutes)
- **Quick check-in** on Week 1 "Hello Copilot" challenge experiences
- **Key learnings** from initial Copilot exploration
- **Session objectives** for advanced techniques

### 2. Writing Effective Comments and Prompts (8 minutes)
#### The Art of Prompt Engineering for Code (5 minutes)
- **Comment-driven development** approach
  - Writing descriptive function headers
  - Specifying input/output expectations
  - Including edge case considerations
- **Best practices for prompts:**
  - Be specific about requirements
  - Include context about the broader system
  - Mention performance or security considerations
  - Specify coding style preferences

#### Live Demo: Before and After (3 minutes)
```python
# Bad prompt example:
# function to sort

# Good prompt example:
# Create a function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specified key
# Input: list of dicts, key name (string)
# Output: sorted list (ascending order)
# Handle: missing keys gracefully, maintain original list
```

### 3. Copilot Chat vs Inline Suggestions (7 minutes)
#### Understanding When to Use Each (4 minutes)
- **Inline suggestions best for:**
  - Code completion and continuation
  - Repetitive patterns
  - Standard implementations
  - Quick fixes and modifications

- **Copilot Chat best for:**
  - Complex problem explanation
  - Code refactoring discussions
  - Learning new concepts
  - Debugging and troubleshooting
  - Architecture decisions

#### Live Comparison Demo (3 minutes)
- **Same task, different approaches:**
  - Building a REST API endpoint
  - Show inline vs chat approaches
  - Highlight strengths of each method

### 4. Advanced Code Generation Scenarios (12 minutes)
#### Complex Algorithm Generation (4 minutes)
**Demo Focus:** Graph algorithms and data structures
- **Prompt:** "Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm"
- **Show:** How Copilot handles complex algorithmic logic
- **Highlight:** Step-by-step generation and explanation

#### Multi-File Project Generation (4 minutes)
**Demo Focus:** Microservice architecture
- **Prompt:** "Create a user authentication service with JWT"
- **Show:** How context spreads across multiple files
- **Highlight:** Consistent naming and pattern recognition

#### Error Handling and Edge Cases (4 minutes)
**Demo Focus:** Robust error handling patterns
- **Prompt:** "Add comprehensive error handling to this function"
- **Show:** Exception handling, logging, validation
- **Highlight:** Security considerations and best practices

### 3. Collaborative Problem-Solving (5 minutes)
#### Group Challenge Session
- **Present a complex coding challenge** to the group
- **Collaborate on prompting strategies**
- **Compare different approaches** and solutions
- **Vote on most effective technique**

**Example Challenge:**
"Create a caching decorator that supports both synchronous and asynchronous functions, with configurable TTL and storage backends"

## Week 2 Mini-Challenge: "Prompt Engineering Mastery"

### Challenge Description
**Objective:** Master the art of effective prompting for code generation

### Tasks:
1. **Refactor Challenge:**
   - Take a poorly documented function from your codebase
   - Use advanced prompting to generate comprehensive documentation
   - Add error handling and optimization suggestions

2. **Multi-Method Implementation:**
   - Choose a programming problem (e.g., implementing a cache)
   - Generate solutions using both inline suggestions and chat
   - Compare and document the differences

3. **Cross-Language Translation:**
   - Implement the same algorithm in 2-3 different languages
   - Use Copilot to help with language-specific optimizations
   - Note how context affects suggestions across languages

### Deliverables:
- **Before/after code samples** with your prompting strategies
- **Screenshot or recording** of your Copilot interaction
- **Reflection document** on what techniques worked best
