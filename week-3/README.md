## Week 3 Challenge: "Domain Mastery"

### Challenge Description
**Objective:** Master Copilot usage within your primary development domain

### Tasks:
1. **Domain Deep-Dive:**
   - Implement a complete feature in your domain using Copilot
   - Document domain-specific prompting patterns you discover
   - Compare Copilot's effectiveness across different tasks

2. **Cross-Domain Exploration:**
   - Try Copilot in a domain you're less familiar with
   - Implement a simple project (e.g., web dev creates ML script)
   - Note differences in suggestion quality and patterns

3. **Testing Integration:**
   - Generate comprehensive tests for your domain project
   - Explore different testing patterns Copilot suggests
   - Measure test coverage and quality improvements

### Deliverables:
- **Complete project** demonstrating domain expertise
