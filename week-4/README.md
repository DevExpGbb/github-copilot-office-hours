### 2. Workflow Integration Strategies (8 minutes)
#### Development Lifecycle Integration (5 minutes)

**Planning Phase Integration:**
- **User story to code structure** generation
- **Technical specification** to implementation outline
- **Architecture decisions** with Copilot consultation

**Development Phase Optimization:**
- **Boilerplate generation** for common patterns
- **Configuration file** creation and management
- **Documentation generation** alongside development

**Code Review Integration:**
- **Self-review assistance** before submission
- **Code explanation** for complex implementations
- **Refactoring suggestions** and improvements

#### Version Control Workflow Integration (3 minutes)
**Version Control Workflow:**
- **Commit message generation** from code changes
- **Branch naming** and PR description assistance
- **Merge conflict resolution** guidance

### 3. Custom Prompts for Repetitive Tasks (8 minutes)
#### Creating Reusable Prompt Templates (5 minutes)

#### Documentation and Specification Prompts (3 minutes)

**Generating Documentation and Explanations:**
- **Code Explanation Prompt:**
  ```
  Explain what this function/class does, including input/output, side effects, and usage examples.
  ```
- **Inline Documentation Prompt:**
  ```
  Add detailed docstrings and inline comments to clarify logic and intent for maintainers.
  ```
- **API Documentation Prompt:**
  ```
  Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for this REST endpoint, including request/response schemas and error codes.
  ```

**Product Requirements and Spec Docs:**
- **PRD Generation Prompt:**
  ```
  Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for this feature, outlining user stories, acceptance criteria, and business goals.
  ```
- **Technical Specification Prompt:**
  ```
  Draft a technical specification for implementing this module, including architecture, dependencies, and integration points.
  ```

These prompts help automate the creation of clear documentation, improve code readability, and streamline the transition from requirements to implementation.

**Test Suite Template:**
```
Create comprehensive tests for [function/class] including:
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Edge case handling
- Mock external dependencies
- Performance assertions
- Integration test scenarios
```

#### Live Demo: Custom Prompt Library (3 minutes)
- **Creating a personal prompt collection** in VS Code snippets
- **Organizing prompts by project type** and technology
- **Sharing prompt libraries** across team members

### 4. Refactoring and Code Optimization (6 minutes)
#### Intelligent Refactoring Demo (4 minutes)

**Legacy Code Modernization:**
```python
# Before: Legacy Python 2.7 style
def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        if item != None:
            result.append(str(item).upper())
    return result

# Copilot-assisted modernization to Python 3.8+
# Prompt: "Refactor this function using modern Python with type hints, 
#          list comprehensions, and proper null handling"
```

TODO: Add in content for COBOL like [DevExpGBB/Cobol-Demo](https://github.com/DevExpGbb/Cobol-Demo)

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Algorithm complexity** improvements
- **Memory usage** optimization
- **Database query** optimization
- **Async/await** pattern implementation

#### Code Quality Enhancement (2 minutes)
- **SOLID principles** application
- **Design pattern** implementation
- **Error handling** improvement
- **Security vulnerability** identification and fixes

#### Validation tasks (3 minutes)
**Critical Thinking Required:**
- **Security-sensitive code** (authentication, encryption)
- **Business logic validation** and complex domain rules
- **Performance-critical sections** requiring optimization
- **Regulatory compliance** code requiring audit trails

**Quality Assurance Needs:**
- **Code review requirements** remain essential
- **Testing verification** of generated code
- **Documentation accuracy** checking
- **Licensing and attribution** considerations

#### Maintaining Coding Skills (2 minutes)
- **Regular practice** without AI assistance
- **Algorithm study** and problem-solving practice
- **Code reading** and understanding exercises
- **Peer programming** and knowledge sharing
